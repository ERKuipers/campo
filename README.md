# Campo

Campo modelling framework for fields and agents

Campo is an environmental modelling framework for the construction of spatio-temporal models with support for field-based and agent-based phenomena.
Campo provides the elementary building blocks for the construction and execution of field-agent models:
operations accepting both fields and agents as arguments, and operations that are dedicated either to fields or to agents.
Campo resembles and extends the map algebra approach to field-agent modelling and allows for the construction of static or dynamic models.


You can find more information on the Campo [project website](http://campo.computationalgeography.org/).
Documentation can be found [here](https://campo.computationalgeography.org/documentation/index.html).
Campo is developed by the [Computational Geography](https://www.computationalgeography.org) group.
